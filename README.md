# Time-Series-Analysis-


This project focuses on the use of time series analysis to examine the relationship between changes in call-money/interbank rate, GDP growth, and inflation rate in India for the past two decades. To be more specific, Vector Auto Regression or VAR will be used to determine the relationship. 

The research question of the project is as follows: How does a change ("shock") in interbank rate impact inflation and GDP growth in India?

For conducting this analysis, statistical tests such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Granger-Causality were used. Finally, Impulse Response Functions were implemented to answer the aforementioned research question.

The tool used in this project is Python programming language and its libraries including pandas and statsmodels. Moreover, the data source is the St.Louis FED website.
